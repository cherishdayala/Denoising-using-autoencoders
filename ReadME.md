###Denoising Using Autoencoders


An autoencoder is an unsupervised neural network that accepts an input data set (i.e, input), internally compresses the input data into a latent spatial representation, and attempts to reconstruct the input data from that latent representation (i.e, output data).
Image denoising is the process of removing noise from a noisy image in order to restore the true image. During the denoising process, it is hard to differentiate between high-frequency components like noise, texture and edge and there might be a loss of few details in denoised images.
